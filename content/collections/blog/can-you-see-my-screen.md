            text: '"Can you see my screen" invites participants to respond. It''s followed by awkward silence as you wait for an audio reply, and since participants were probably told to "please mute your mics" it introduces a conflict of instruction.'

            text: 'And, what''s your plan for if they can''t see your screen? In Zoom, it''s obvious when your screen has been shared because it takes over the majority of the window. If a participant tells you they can''t see it, and you know you''ve already done all you can to share it, you''re setting yourself up for a frantic scramble in the event that someone''s internet connection is laggy.'

            text: 'Telling participants to "share in chat if you can''t see my screen" does not provoke an immediate pause to your presentation. You can give this instruction and get started without an awkward interruption. If someone does share in chat, you know that''s where you will see the feedback instead of waiting for an audio reply OR a chat reply.'

            text: 'And for your laggy participants, they may write in chat that they can''t see, giving others a chance to rebut if they CAN see. So your issue will hopefully resolve itself organically as the laggy participant does their own troubleshooting without you interrupting your entire meeting trying fruitlessly to help that one person since the issue is on their end and not yours.'

            text: 'When you share a presentation, and it appears on the screen for everyone to see, do not begin by saying "Can everyone read the screen?" What if they can''t? Do you actually have a contingency plan? Probably not, so replace that question with a statement of instruction, like "If you can''t read the screen please don''t be afraid to come closer." This puts you in the driver seat as a leader and problem solver.'
